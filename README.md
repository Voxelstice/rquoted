# rquoted
The peak of entertainment

Made with discord.js and node.js

# Setup
Easy-peasy to set up. Be sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

First, you have to set up a few stuff in the config.json file. Token and userId are the most necessary ones. I won't explain how to do it here.

Open up command prompt, then do:
```
git clone https://github.com/Voxelstice/rquoted.git
```

Once the cloning process is complete, now do the following to boot the bot up!
```
node .
```
