# rquoted
The peak of entertainment (this is a bot that does randomized quotes n stuff)

Made with discord.js and node.js

Hosted with [repl.it](https://replit.com/) and [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), along with express

# Setup
Easy-peasy to set up. Be sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and node.js installed.

Open up command prompt, then do:
```
git clone https://github.com/Voxelstice/rquoted.git
```

Once the cloning process is complete, you have to do some things.

First of all, you need to do run the `npm init` command, then the `npm install discord.js express` command.

Second of all, you have to set up a few stuff in the config.json file. Token and userId are the most necessary ones. I won't explain how to do it here.

Then do the following to boot the bot up!
```
node .
```
